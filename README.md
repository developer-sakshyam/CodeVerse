# 🌍 About CodeVerse

CodeVerse is a futuristic platform that combines the thrill of gaming with the power of coding education.
It’s not just a place to learn — it’s a digital arena where coders from around the world compete head-to-head in timed programming challenges.

Every match is a test of logic, speed, and focus. You don’t just code — you fight with code.

# ⚙️ How It Works

Join the Arena – Pick your language and difficulty.

Matchmaking – Instantly paired with another coder at your skill level.

Battle Begins – Both receive the same problem; whoever solves it first wins.

Earn Points – Win matches, climb ranks, and unlock exclusive tiers.

Built-in AI dynamically generates problems, so every battle feels unique.
This isn’t just practice — it’s progress with adrenaline.
